This project explores The Well Dataset, a large collection of 15+ TB of physics simulations spanning turbulence, fluid dynamics, elasticity, reaction–diffusion, plasma, and more. The goal is to build a single neural model capable of learning across all datasets in The Well — generalizing across different PDEs, domains, and physical regimes.

The project includes:

&middot;loading and preprocessing arbitrary subsets of The Well

&middot;visualizing scalar and vector fields

&middot;training unified sequence-to-sequence models on diverse physics datasets

&middot;evaluating predictions using variance-scaled RMSE (VRMSE)

This is an ongoing research project aimed at understanding cross-physics generalization and developing a model that can learn the entire Well Dataset.
